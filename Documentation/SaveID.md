# Save IDs

## Concept
The first line of a save file seems to be an ID that provides both the campaign and the save game with a unique identifier.

## Example
For example, `SAV010341a5d1750000027` \
`00000275` - The last 8 digits seem to be a campaign ID. \
`SAV010341a5d1` - The meaning of the rest is currently unknown, but together they create a unique ID for the save.
